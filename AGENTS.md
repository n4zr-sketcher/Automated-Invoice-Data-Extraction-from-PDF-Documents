# UiPath Project: Automated Invoice Data Extraction from PDF Documents

Type: Process · Target: Windows · Expressions: VisualBasic · Studio: 26.0.204

## Working here

- Load the `uipath-rpa` skill for anything touching a workflow file. For other `uip` areas use the
  matching skill, or `uip <cmd> --help` — not this file.
- `.xaml`, `.cs` and `project.json` are strict-schema files Studio must be able to reopen. Edit them
  through the skill's conventions, leave the Studio-generated view-state blocks alone, and run
  `uip rpa validate` after every change.
- Done means `uip rpa validate` comes back clean and `uip rpa build` succeeds. A change is not
  finished until both do.
- `uip rpa run` executes on this machine and may drive the desktop UI. Confirm with the user first.
- Only `uip rpa publish` when explicitly asked — it pushes a version to a shared Orchestrator tenant.

## Layout

- `Main.xaml` — entry point
- `project.json` — manifest: dependencies, entry point, expression language, target framework.
  Ground truth; prefer it over the header above, which is a snapshot from creation time.
- `.objects/`, `.screenshots/` — Object Repository source. Commit these.
- `.settings/` — project settings. Commit these.
- `.local/` — generated. Don't edit or commit.

## When something is missing

- **`uip` not found** — ask the user to install it; it needs admin rights and installs runtimes, so
  don't run it yourself. A new shell is needed afterwards before `uip` is on PATH.
  `curl -fsSL https://download.uipath.com/uipath-cli/install.sh | bash` (macOS/Linux) or
  `irm https://download.uipath.com/uipath-cli/install.ps1 | iex` (Windows).
  Install trouble behind a corporate proxy is usually `@uipath` npm scope configuration:
  <https://docs.uipath.com/coding-agents/standalone/latest/user-guide/install-and-set-up>
- **No UiPath skills in your skill list** — run `uip skills install`, then restart the agent session.
  Skills installed mid-session are not loaded into the one already running.
- **Auth error** on anything touching Orchestrator, Studio Web, Integration Service or publishing —
  ask the user to run `uip login`. It opens a browser, so you can't complete it yourself.
  Non-interactive alternative: `uip login --client-id <id> --client-secret <secret>`.
- **No user to ask** (headless or CI) — stop and report the blocker. Don't install, publish, or guess.
